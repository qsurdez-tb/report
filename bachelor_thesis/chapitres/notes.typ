== 17.02

17.02 - After the meeting with my supervisor, things are clearer in my mind. Big themes of the thesis will be, security processes and how all the crypto is handled, how to make sure the deployment of a new instance is seamless, demistify the procedure to retrieve the data in the case of a backup (needs clarification), new features to add in the webapp.

17.02 - Explored the solutions for the template to use for the thesis. Chosen the official one.

17.02 - Tried to begin the planning on github as I suggested. I then saw the example yaml file provided in the typst template. I will first draft a simple table on paper or in md and then choose a display solution. 

17.02 - Everything in english or french ? !QUESTION

17.02 - Reading Gantty docs.

17.02 - Creating draft of planning on paper.

17.02 - Reporting planning to yaml for gantty.

17.02 - Thinking hard about wether or not I missed smth in the planning...

17.02 - Noticed some errors ^^' Forgot to consider the week of crunch as a week without work on the thesis... urrgh hate crunch

17.02 - Look around the specification of other's report to understand better what's expected

17.02 - Trying to write the summary of the problem, not an easy task !

17.02 - Used the description of the bachelor thesis as a base and translated it mostly

== 19.02

0822 - Thought quite a bit about the structure of the planning. Want to make it more detailed with mention of what, regarding to the report, is done.

0822 - Reflected on using branches for planning and spec. I think it's not overkill as it will help undersanding how I work and each brnach will be focused on a specific interest.

0856 - Managed to write the vision I had for the first part of the planning. But now how do I handle the notes, only commits in main or on respective branches ? !QUESTION

0919 - Finished writing the focus crypto part. I feel like I underestimate the time it will take me to write the documentation ? Knowing the arcane way the work of Marco is written we shall see ^^'

0924 - I think that after setting up the dev env, I will be a bit less anxious about it ! It's currently a multi-repo project and I think that's what worries me a bit

0935 - I'm not too sure about the planning, it feels like I'm missing something... Will see after the feedback from supervisor
